# 60fps GUI
### Introduction
A simple modification to the games redswfs to increase the framerate of the UI to 60fps creating a much more smoother experience

Due to the nature of flash files, this will mean that any animations or transitions in the UI will now move at twice their original speed. There is no workaround for this apart from redoing every animation which is very time consuming

### Compatability
This mod will conflict with most other mods that edit redswf files. This mod should act as a baseline though so give other mods priority over this one

### Installation
Download the main file under "releases". Extract the file from the archive and place the mod in your main directory/mods folder. If this folder does not exist, create it

### Uninsatllation
Take the mod file out of the mods folder

### Credits
MrFlashMode for creating the original 60fps GUI
