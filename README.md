# Smooth GUI for Witcher 3 Complete Edition
### Introduction
A simple modification to the games redswfs to double the framerate of the UI to 60fps/48fps creating a much more smoother experience

Due to the nature of flash files, this will mean that any animations or transitions in the UI will now move at twice their original speed. There is no workaround for this apart from redoing every animation which is very time consuming

This mod is based on the original 60fps GUI mod by MrFlashMode. Do endorse the original mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3501)

### Compatability
This mod will conflict with most other mods that edit redswf files. This mod should act as a baseline though so give other mods priority over this one

### Installation
Download the main file under "releases". Extract the file from the archive and place the mod in your main directory/mods folder. If this folder does not exist, create it

### Uninstallation
Take the mod file out of the mods folder

### Credits
MrFlashMode for creating the original 60fps GUI
