# Smooth GUI for Witcher 3 Complete Edition
### Introduction
A simple modification to the games redswfs to double the framerate of the UI to 60fps/48fps creating a much more smoother experience

Due to the nature of flash files, this will mean that any animations or transitions in the UI will now move at twice their original speed. There is no workaround for this apart from redoing every animation which is very time consuming

This mod is based on the original 60fps GUI mod by MrFlashMode. Do endorse the original mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3501)

### Compatability
This mod will conflict with most other mods that edit redswf files. This mod should act as a baseline though so give other mods priority over this one

I have made adaptations for some mods that also edit redswf files. The following are supported:
- All Quest Objectives On Map (Standard and Full)
- Colored Map Markers (Normal and AQOOM)
- Sort Everything

If you are using one of these then download the additional "Adaptations" file, look for the relevant patch and install it into the mod folder. I have marked some folders with "OG Mod Required" indicating that you need the original mod as well as the adaptation
Make sure that the adaptation has priority over both Smooth GUI and the adapted mod

### Installation
Download the main file under "releases". Extract the file from the archive and place the mod in your main directory/mods folder. If this folder does not exist, create it

### Uninstallation
Take the mod file out of the mods folder
